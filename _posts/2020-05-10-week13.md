# Gatsby Chronicles:  
For this week in Gatsby, I began working on the second issue that I had chosen. To give a clear recap on what the issue was about, the issue was concerned with two dependency libraries that had outdated versions and that needed to be severely upgraded. The two dependency libraries were puppeteer and puppeteer-core. The puppeteer library is used for the gatsby-plugin-preload-fonts package within the Gatsby project. The other library is puppeteer-core and is used within the gatsby-transformer-screenshot package in the Gatsby project. This issue was originally raised because someone was having problems when running yarn install within the Gatsby project. It appears that he was having trouble running the command "yarn install" that might've been caused by puppeteer since that is where the installing seemed to stayed stuck at. Although he has since gotten the command to run successfully, someone opened up an issue because the puppeteer and puppeteer-core library versions used within the project are indeed outdated. It was possible that the error might've been caused by this. 

I decided to pick this issue up. I did a ton of research about the latest versions of puppeteer and puppeteer-core to see what changes have been implemented since version 1.20.0 for puppeteer and 2.1.0 for puppeteer-core. 1.20.0 and 2.1.0 are the current versions being used within the Gatsby project so I wanted to make sure that there wasn't any major changes from the latest versions that would break anything that was being used within the Gatsby project. I also looked into all the places where puppeteer and puppeteer-core are being used within the Gatsby project and there wasn't all that many places which is great. From my research, I discovered that the latest versions of puppeteer and puppeteer-core rely on all node versions from 10.18.1 and up. Fortunately, the Gatsby project currently supports all node versions from 10.13.0 and up so this means that there wouldn't be a conflict with node when upgrading the library versions.

Once I felt like I had done enough research, and seen that there most likely wouldn't be any conflicts when upgrading the two outdated library versions, I decided to proceed and upgrade them using yarn. I navigated to the two directories within the Gatsby project in which they are both being used and upgraded them. When upgrading puppeteer, I got an error that stated something along the lines such as "expected workspace package to exist for \rimraf\"". As a result of this, I had to do some extensive searches to see what this issue was concerned with and what was causing it. There weren't many results when I searched through google for this so it was pretty tough trying to figure this one out. After a lot of tweaks to my search query, I found out that this issue has not yet been handled in the most recent versions of  (I had one of the latest versions 1.22.0), but rather in earlier versions so I had to downgrade my current version of yarn.  For puppeteer-core, I also got a few tricky errors that took me a while to solve, none of which are all that rememberable to me at this point in time. I do recall having to fix something though relating to yarn's cache because of a fetching cache problem. 

Despite all of the hassles, I was eventually able to upgrade both versions of the libraries to their latest version with everything working successfully, and proceeded to push to my branch within our class fork of the Gatsby project. I created a pull request, gave a quick description of my changes, and linked it to the issue. Hopefully, my changes for this second task are merged very soon!
