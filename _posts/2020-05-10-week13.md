# Gatsby Chronicles:  
For this week in Gatsby, I began working on the second issue that I had chosen. To give a clear recap on what the issue was about, the issue was concerned with two dependency libraries that had outdated versions and that needed to be severely upgraded. The two dependency libraries were puppeteer and puppeteer-core. The puppeteer library is used for the gatsby-plugin-preload-fonts package within the Gatsby project. The other library is puppeteer-core and is used within the gatsby-transformer-screenshot package in the Gatsby project. This issue was originally raised because someone was having problems when running yarn install within the Gatsby project. It appears that he was having troubles running the command "yarn install" that might've been caused by puppeteer since that is where the installing seemed to stayed stuck at. Although he has since gotten the command to run successfully, someone opened up an issue because the puppeteer and puppeteer-core library versions used within the project are indeed outdated. It was possible that the error might've been caused by this. 

I decided to pick this issue up. I did a ton of research about the latest versions of puppeteer and puppeteer-core to see what changes have been implemented since version 1.20.0 for puppeteer and 2.1.0 for puppeteer-core. 1.20.0 and 2.1.0 are the current versions being used within the Gatsby project so I wanted to make sure that wasn't any major change from the latest versions that would break anything that was being used within the Gatsby project. I also looked into all the places where puppeteer and puppeteer-core are being used within the Gatsby project and there wasn't all that many places which is great. From my research, I discovered that the latest versions of puppeteer and puppeteer-core rely on all node versions from 10.18.1 and up. Fortunately, the Gatsby project currently supports all node versions from 10.13.0 and up so this means that there wouldn't be a conflict with node when upgrading the library versions.

Once I felt like I had done enough research, and seen that there most likely wouldn't be any conflicts when upgrading the two outdated library versions, I decided to proceed and upgrade them using yarn. I navigated to the two directories within the Gatsby project in which they are both being used and upgraded them. When upgrading puppeteer, I got an error that stated something along the lines such as "expected workspace package to exist for \rimraf\"". As a result of this, I had to do some extensive searches to see what this issue is concerned with and what was causing it.
