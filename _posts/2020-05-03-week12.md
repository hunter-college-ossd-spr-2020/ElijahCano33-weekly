# Gatsby Chronicles & Issue Analysis: :mag:

This past week I have done a lot research on a few particular Gatsby issues that I have been interested in. Last week I mentioned an issue in my blog that seemed interesting, but I had doubts about it. The issue was concerned with helping the Gatsby team continue to flesh out all their gatsby-node-api function descriptions. The Gatsby team currently feels as though there is still a lot of confusion relating to their gatsby-node api functions and because of this they are looking for someone to go through all of gastby-node api functions and add further context about each one and include important information about each api function such as what parameters it is expecting to be passed into it as well as an example detailing how to actually use it. I expressed interest, but I had doubts simply for the fact that I personally didn't feel that I had the necessary experience with these api functions to actually be able to really flesh them out in a way where I could really help others comprehend it very well. Nevertheless, I still decided to attempt to see if I could do it. I didn't request to work on it because I prefer to work on the task locally first and get a sense of it to see if I can actually complete before I notify the Gatsby team to see if I can work on it. I began working on it and for some of the api functions it is somewhat easy to identify the exact parameters and what exactly those parameters are supposed to be, but for others it is also not so easy to understand unless you have experience using them. For example, with the onCreateDevServer api function the parameter is very easy to identify, it's trivial to understand that it's the express app that's used to make requests to the server as well as run it, but for other ones such as the createPagesStatefully api function the parameters are not easy to identify nor is it clear what those parameters are really supposed to be. Gatsby does provide a link alongisde these api functions to their location in the index.js file in their source code, but even there it's not super clear how everything works for that api function. As a result of this, I decided to not request to work on this issue simply because I feel that this issue would be a better fit for someone who has more experience using these apis.

Another issue that I looked into was this [one](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23421). This issue was concerned with two outdated versions for the dependency libraries called puppeteer and puppeteer-core within the Gatsby project. The person that opened up the issue is requesting that the versions for these two depencies be updated to the latest version because the primary version that is being used by the Gatsby team is version 1.20.0 for puppeteer and version 2.1.0 for puppeteer-core and these versions are outdated as the latest version for both seems to be 3.0.2. Initially, I thought this was a good issue to work on so I decided to do some research about the latest version of puppeteer and what changes have been made since version 1.20.0. Of course, with a very mature project such as Gatsby, you have to be very careful when updating packages from very outdated versions to the newest and latest version because those new latest version can have tons of large changes and possibly break a ton of stuff since the code that was implemented with the outdated version of the package may no longer work with the new and latest version. I began doing some research within the Gatsby project to see all the places where puppeteer is being used, and it appears that both puppeteer and puppeteer-core are only being used in a very select amount of places within the Gatsby project. I thought that was great because that potentially means that the risk of breaking a lot of stuff from updating the outdate version of the package to the latest version would be extremely minimal. Along with this, I also decided to go to the package's pages to see exactly what new features and changes have been made from version to version. Upon analyzing this information, I discovered that the new versions specifially those past version 3.0.0 rely on Node 10.18.1+. I checked the Gatsby project to see what version of Node they are running to see that they are currently supporting all version of node that are greater than or equal to 8.0.0.
